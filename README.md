# Habit Tracker

## The Ultimate Tool for Habit Formation and Tracking

This application will help users build and maintain healthy habits. Some key features include:
- **Habit creation**: users can create custom habits and have them displayed on the platform
- **Progress tracking**: users check off their habits daily if they complete them. 
     - Users can also view the number of consecutive days they have successfully maintained their habit. 


This app will be used by individuals who struggle to stay consistent or need motivation to complete their daily goals. The app can help students, athletes, or any other goal-oriented individual stay accountable and maintain good habits. 

This project interests me because I often find it difficult to stay disciplined and consistent with my goals. I see this project as an opportunity to develop a solution for myself and others facing similar challenges.
